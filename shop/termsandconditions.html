            <li>The text of these General Terms and Conditions will be made available to the Consumer free of charge before the distance contract is concluded. If this is not reasonably possible, the Entrepreneur will indicate how the terms can be accessed and that they will be sent free of charge upon request.</li>
            <li>If the distanceいい contract is concluded electronically, the terms may be provided electronically in a way that the Consumer can store them on a durable medium. If this is not feasible, the Entrepreneur will indicate where the terms can be viewed electronically and that they will be sent free of charge upon request.</li>
            <li>In case specific product or service conditions apply in addition to these terms, the Consumer may invoke the provision most favorable to them in case of conflicting terms.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>The offer includes a complete and accurate description of the products, digital content, and/or services. The description is sufficiently detailed to allow the Consumer to make a proper assessment. Images used are accurate representations, and obvious errors or mistakes in the offer do not bind the Entrepreneur.</li>
            <li>All offers include clear information about the Consumer’s rights and obligations upon acceptance.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Article 5 – The Agreement</h2>

            <li>If the agreement is concluded electronically, the Entrepreneur will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure data transfer and ensure a safe web environment. If electronic payment is possible, appropriate security measures will be observed.</li>
            <li>Within legal limits, the Entrepreneur may investigate the Consumer’s ability to meet payment obligations and other relevant factors for responsibly entering the distance contract. The Entrepreneur may refuse an order or attach special conditions based on this investigation.</li>
            <li>Before delivery, the Entrepreneur will provide the Consumer with written or digitally accessible information, including the business address for complaints, conditions for exercising the right of withdrawal, after-sales service information, price details, delivery costs, payment methods, and cancellation requirements.</li>

            <li>The Consumer does not bear costs for digital content not on a physical carrier if they did not consent to performance before the reflection period or acknowledge the loss of withdrawal rights.</li>

            <li>Reimbursement will use the same payment method unless the Consumer agrees otherwise, free of charge.</li>
            <li>If the Consumer chose a more expensive delivery method, the Entrepreneur is not required to reimburse the additional costs.</li>
